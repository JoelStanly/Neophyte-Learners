# Neophyte Learners

## Welcome

###### What is Neophyte Learners?
This is a group where the students who are interested can learn and earn at the same time. This is a public group where we give a coding problem per day. Whomever comes with the solution within the time limit will be awarded some neophyte coins.

###### How much is the Neophyte coins worth?
We are limited to our resources but we are trying our best to provide money and new kind of questions to students to learn. So the neophyte coins is variable but now the current price is 1 ruppee for 2 coins. As we grow, we will increase the amount for it.

###### What happens when you don't know the answer?
Do not worry, if u don't come up with a solution. You can earn even some partial amount for the partial solution. If u can't even get an answer, no problem because we will provide the solution here with a video explanation. So learn from it and better ~~luck~~ **try** next time.

###### How to join?
This page is public and anyone can view the contents. But to join and earn,you need to in our whatsapp group. ** *It's Absolutely free* **
